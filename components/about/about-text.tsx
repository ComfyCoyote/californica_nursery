export const aboutText1 = "I have always admired the outdoors in many ways- hiking, surfing, freediving, and climbing were just a few of my many excuses for me to get outside and enjoy the greenery. "
export const aboutText2 = "While studying at UC Santa Cruz, I had a realization that, although pursuing more traditional majors (business management, economics, communications) would be profitable, I knew that I truly wouldn’t be as happy as I am spending time in nature. I was nearly addicted at this point- If I wasn’t studying or skateboarding (my first love), I was most definitely out in the woods, foraging for mushrooms and climbing redwoods (textbook granola guy, I know)"
export const aboutText3 = "About halfway through college (2019), I changed my major to environmental studies and did a rare wildflower restoration internship at Fort Ord in Salinas. I was incredibly lucky to work with Brett Bell, a very talented botanist and artist based in Monterey. He introduced me to an app called iNaturalist, which is a massive database where citizen scientists can identify and record locations of any living thing on earth. As soon as I got the hang of it, I was hooked- I had unlocked a whole new world of knowledge and inspiration, on my iPhone! Everyday hikes turned into botanical expeditions, where stopping, crouching down, and snapping photos of inconspicuous flowers were the new norm."
export const aboutText4 = "Day hikes turned into two week-long camping trips, where I was looking for the rare, overlooked, and bizarre native plants of California. I like to think of it as a more meaningful addiction to pokemon (no offense to my gamers). With each new expedition, my appetite for the outdoors became insatiable."
export const aboutText5 = "loss that has already occurred in so many regions of California, like the Los Angeles basin being a concrete jungle, the central valley being a sea of farms, and the sacred spaces of California’s indigenous people being bulldozed and built over. I was born and raised in Long Beach and was privileged enough to leave and see our wild places, but for someone without this privilege, what is nature to them, and why does it matter?"
export const aboutText6 = "Fast forward to Spring of 2020- COVID-induced lockdown had begun, and we were tied to our living spaces. In between online class and sleep, I had a lot of time to do whatever I wanted. Although this seems nice to some, it really wasn’t for me. I’m always trying to keep myself occupied, so I just simply couldn't sit around and do nothing."
export const aboutText7 = "I got a job at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, where I was allowed to work outside with others doing horticultural maintenance and small construction and landscaping projects. This was pure freedom- getting paid to indulge in the world’s most spectacular flora! I was able to see the ins-and-outs of the arboretum’s nursery operation, and needless to say, I was fascinated. South African Proteas, Chilean conifers, Australian Grevilleas, and the most amazing- California’s rare and threatened native plants. I became a resident of our conservation gardens and nursery."
export const aboutText8 = "With this newfound love and increasing level of boredom, what was I to do? Grow native plants! And so I did. I grew hundreds of plants in my dusty backyard during that Spring, and I haven’t stopped since then."
export const aboutText9 = "Jackson and I reconvened after college and I was able to share my excitement with him too, which eventually resulted in our joint partnership as Californica Nursery. Working with one of my best friends has been a blast and I’m so excited for what’s to come!"
