export const bio1 = 'While parks and other refugia from urban sprawl is undoubtedly an amazing resource for the public, they are quite sterile. Miles of grass turf and non-native ornamental trees flank these parklands, providing little habitat and food sources for our local wildlife and little respite for humans. For one to reach intact, publicly-accessible native habitat from Long Beach, you’d need to drive at least 30 minutes to reach any nearby destination. This just isn’t right.'

export const iansBio = 'We were both born and raised in Long Beach but went to different locations on the West Coast for higher education. We studied ecological restoration, biology, and conservation, and grew quite fond of California native ecology, specifically our native plants. When we reconvened, we both agreed upon the fact that there are incredible benefits of having natural areas nearby and in your own backyard. Wildlife was in much higher magnitude in these areas and water savings skyrocketed. The privilege to escape from our urban enclosures was always a possibility. In our hometown, however, this wasn’t as easy a task.'

export const jacksonsBio = 'What could we do to make a positive change in our community? Grow what needs to be there.And so we did, and we never stopped. Positive changes happened in our own backyards and guerilla gardens almost instantly. We spread the word far and wide, and kept preaching the importance of and educating about California native plants, and things already started to look better. To know how much positive change you could bring to your own backyard was astounding.There is a plethora of work to be done, but we are always doing what we can to re-wild the urban jungle. One house, one plant, one seed at a time.'
